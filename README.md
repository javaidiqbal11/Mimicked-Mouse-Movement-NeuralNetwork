# Mimicked-Mouse-Movement-NeuralNetwork
The goal is to develop a neural network / machine learning based solution to generate mimicked movements from a mouse given an initial xy position and a final xy position. Datasets will not be provided, and the different vectors used to generate the path will need to be determined.
